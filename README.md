#### Description
1. Put/Sheath weapons on back, with custom components.
2. Weapon is diplayed via switching weapons.
3. [Demo here](https://youtu.be/ArKqJMv8ZIE).
#### Known issues
1. It seems too much omponents/tints on weapon objects would cause unknown crash(eg: crash when switch to first-person), I've limited up to 3 weapon objects to diplay, and tested only 1-2 players online and works fine. If players encounter more frequent crash related to thia script, please provide detail info.
2. Currently "attached" position is not fit well on every models.
3. If you find more issues, feel free to post it.
